# Character Maker

A simple program designed in FLTK using FLUID to quickly create the UI, and written in Rust because it is easier to understand, and more clean.

## Ini files

Currently this program only supports `.ini` file format, and requires the `tini` library for these operations.

## WIP

This is in the early stages, and will eventually support a better set of statistics for the characters, potentially even multple types, and even multiple output/input formats (like `json` for example)
